# Challenge #5: üëû Shoe pairing

**Santa Claus's elves** üßùüßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è have found a bunch of mismatched magic boots in the workshop. Each boot is described by two values:

- `type` indicates if it's a left boot (I) or a right boot (R).
- `size` indicates the size of the boot.

Your task is to help the elves pair all the boots of the same size having a left and a right one. To do this, you should return a list of the available boots after pairing them.

**Note**: You can have more than one pair of boots of the same size!

```js
const shoes = [
  { type: 'I', size: 38 },
  { type: 'R', size: 38 },
  { type: 'R', size: 42 },
  { type: 'I', size: 41 },
  { type: 'I', size: 42 }
]

organizeShoes(shoes)
// [38, 42]

const shoes2 = [
  { type: 'I', size: 38 },
  { type: 'R', size: 38 },
  { type: 'I', size: 38 },
  { type: 'I', size: 38 },
  { type: 'R', size: 38 }
]
// [38, 38]

const shoes3 = [
  { type: 'I', size: 38 },
  { type: 'R', size: 36 },
  { type: 'R', size: 42 },
  { type: 'I', size: 41 },
  { type: 'I', size: 43 }
]

organizeShoes(shoes3)
// []
```

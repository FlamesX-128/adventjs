# Challenge #23: ğŸ”¢ Find the missing numbers

The elves are working on a system to verify children's gift lists ğŸ‘§ğŸ‘¦. However, some lists are incomplete and **numbers are missing!**

Your task is to write **a function that, given an array of numbers, finds all the numbers that are missing between 1 and `n`** (where `n` is the size of the array or the highest number in the array).

Keep in mind that:

- Numbers may appear more than once and others may be missing
- The array always contains positive integers
- Counting always starts from 1

```js
findMissingNumbers([1, 2, 4, 6])
// [3, 5]

findMissingNumbers([4, 8, 7, 2])
// [1, 3, 5, 6]

findMissingNumbers([3, 2, 1, 1])
// []

findDisappearedNumbers([5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1])
// [4]
```

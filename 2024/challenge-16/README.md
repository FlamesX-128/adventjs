# Challenge #16: ❄️ Cleaning the snow path

The elves are working hard to clear paths filled with magical snow ❄️. This snow has a special property: if two **identical and adjacent** snow piles are found, **they disappear automatically**.

Your task is to write a function to help the elves simulate this process. **The path is represented by a string and each snow pile by a character**.

You need to remove all adjacent snow piles that are the same **until no more moves are possible**.

The result should be the final path after removing all duplicate piles:

```js
removeSnow('zxxzoz') // -> "oz"
// 1. Remove "xx", resulting in "zzoz"
// 2. Remove "zz", resulting in "oz"

removeSnow('abcdd') // -> "abc"
// 1. Remove "dd", resulting in "abc"

removeSnow('zzz') // -> "z"
// 1. Remove "zz", resulting in "z"

removeSnow('a') // -> "a"
// No duplicate piles
```

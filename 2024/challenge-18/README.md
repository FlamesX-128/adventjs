# Challenge #18: ðŸ“‡ Santa's Magic Agenda

Santa Claus has a magic diary ðŸ“‡ where he keeps the addresses of the children to deliver the presents. The problem: **the diary's information is mixed and misformatted**. The lines contain a magic phone number, a child's name, and their address, but everything is surrounded by strange characters.

Santa needs your help to find specific information from the diary. Write a function that, **given the diary's content and a phone number, returns the child's name and address**.

Keep in mind that in the diary:

Phone numbers are formatted as +X-YYY-YYY-YYY (where X is one or two digits, and Y is a digit).
Each child's name is always between < and >
The idea is for you to write a function that, given the full phone number or part of it, returns the child's name and address. **If it doesn't find anything or there is more than one result**, you must return `null`.

```js
const agenda = `+34-600-123-456 Calle Gran Via 12 <Juan Perez>
Plaza Mayor 45 Madrid 28013 <Maria Gomez> +34-600-987-654
<Carlos Ruiz> +1-800-555-0199 Fifth Ave New York`

findInAgenda(agenda, '34-600-123-456')
// { name: "Juan Perez", address: "Calle Gran Via 12" }

findInAgenda(agenda, '600-987')
// { name: "Maria Gomez", address: "Plaza Mayor 45 Madrid 28013" }

findInAgenda(agenda, '111')
// null
// Explanation: No results

findInAgenda(agenda, '1')
// null
// Explanation: Too many results
```

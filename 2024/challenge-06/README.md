# Challenge #6: 📦 Is the gift inside the box?

We have already wrapped hundreds of presents 🎁… but an elf forgot to check if the present, represented by an asterisk `\*`, is inside the box.

The box has a present (`\*`) and counts as "*inside the box*" if:

- It is completely surrounded by `#` on the box's edges.
- The `\*` is not on the box's edges.

Keep in mind that the `\*` can be inside, outside, or may not even be there. We must return `true` if the `\*` is inside the box and `false` otherwise.

Examples:

```js
inBox([
  "###",
  "#*#",
  "###"
]) // ➞ true

inBox([
  "####",
  "#* #",
  "#  #",
  "####"
]) // ➞ true

inBox([
  "#####",
  "#   #",
  "#  #*",
  "#####"
]) // ➞ false

inBox([
  "#####",
  "#   #",
  "#   #",
  "#   #",
  "#####"
]) // ➞ false
```

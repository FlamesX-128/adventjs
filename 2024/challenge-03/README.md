# Challenge #3: üèóÔ∏è Organizing the inventory

Santa Claus üéÖ is checking his workshop inventory to prepare gift delivery. The elves have recorded the toys in an *array of objects*, but the information is a bit disorganized. **You need to help Santa organize the inventory**.

You will receive an array of objects, where **each object represents a toy and has the properties**:

- `name`: the name of the toy (string).
- `quantity`: the available quantity of that toy (integer).
- `category`: the category to which the toy belongs (string).

Write a function that processes this array and returns an object that organizes the toys as follows:

- The keys of the object will be the categories of toys.
- The values will be objects that have the toy names as keys and the total quantities of each toy in that category as values.
- If there are toys with the same name in the same category, you must sum their quantities.
- If the array is empty, the function should return an empty object {}.

```js
const inventory = [
  { name: 'doll', quantity: 5, category: 'toys' },
  { name: 'car', quantity: 3, category: 'toys' },
  { name: 'ball', quantity: 2, category: 'sports' },
  { name: 'car', quantity: 2, category: 'toys' },
  { name: 'racket', quantity: 4, category: 'sports' }
]

organizeInventory(inventory)

// Expected result:
// {
//   toys: {
//     doll: 5,
//     car: 5
//   },
//   sports: {
//     ball: 2,
//     racket: 4
//   }

const inventory2 = [
  { name: 'book', quantity: 10, category: 'education' },
  { name: 'book', quantity: 5, category: 'education' },
  { name: 'paint', quantity: 3, category: 'art' }
]

organizeInventory(inventory2)

// Expected result:
// {
//   education: {
//     book: 15
//   },
//   art: {
//     paint: 3
//   }
// }
```

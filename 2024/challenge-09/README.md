# Challenge #9: ðŸš‚ The magic train

The elves are playing with a **magical train ðŸš‚ that carries gifts**. This train moves on a board represented by an **array of strings**.

The train consists of an engine (`@`), followed by its carriages (`o`), and must collect magical fruits (`\*`) which serve as fuel. The movement of the train follows these rules:

You will receive two parameters `board` and `mov`.

`board` is an array of strings that represents the board:

- `@` is the train's engine.
- `o` are the train's carriages.
- `\*` is a magical fruit.
- `Â·` are empty spaces.

`mov` is a string that indicates the next movement of the train from the train's head `@`:

- `'L'`: left
- `'R'`: right
- `'U'`: up
- `'D'`: down.

With this information, you must return a string:

- `'crash'`: If the train crashes into the edges of the board or itself.
- `'eat'`: If the train collects a magical fruit (`*`).
- `'none'`: If it moves without crashing or collecting any magical fruit.

Example:

```js
const board = [
  'Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·',
  '*Â·Â·Â·Â·',
  '@Â·Â·Â·Â·',
  'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·',
  'oÂ·Â·Â·Â·'
]

console.log(moveTrain(board, 'U'))
// âžž 'eat'
// Because the train moves up and finds a magical fruit

console.log(moveTrain(board, 'D'))
// âžž 'crash'
// The train moves down and the head crashes into itself

console.log(moveTrain(board, 'L'))
// âžž 'crash'
// The train moves to the left and crashes into the wall

console.log(moveTrain(board, 'R'))
// âžž 'none'
// The train moves to the right and there is empty space on the right
```

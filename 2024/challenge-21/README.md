# Challenge #21: 🎄 Calculate the height of the Christmas tree

Santa Claus 🎅 is decorating a magical Christmas tree 🪄, which this year has a special structure in the form of a **binary tree**. Each node of the tree represents a gift, and Santa wants to know the **height of the tree** to place the magical star at the top.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the height of a binary tree. The height of a binary tree is defined as the maximum number of levels from the root to a leaf. An empty tree has a height of `0`.

```js
// Tree definition
const tree = {
  value: '🎁',
  left: {
    value: '🎄',
    left: {
      value: '⭐',
      left: null,
      right: null
    },
    right: {
      value: '🎅',
      left: null,
      right: null
    }
  },
  right: {
    value: '❄️',
    left: null,
    right: {
      value: '🦌',
      left: null,
      right: null
    }
  }
}

// Graphical representation of the tree:
//        🎁
//       /   \
//     🎄     ❄️
//    /  \      \
//  ⭐   🎅      🦌

// Function call
treeHeight(tree)
// Returns: 3
```

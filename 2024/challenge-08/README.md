# Challenge #8: ðŸ¦Œ The reno race

**It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys!** ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.

Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track **in isometric format**.

The information you receive:

- `indices`: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
- `0`: The lane is empty.
- **Positive number**: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
- **Negative number**: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
- `length`: The length of each lane.

Return a string representing the race track:

- Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (`~`).
- Each reindeer is represented with the letter `r`.
- Lanes are numbered at the end with `/1`, `/2`, etc.
- The view is **isometric**, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.

**Examples:**

```js
drawRace([0, 5, -3], 10)
/*
  ~~~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~r~~ /3
*/

drawRace([2, -1, 0, 5], 8)
/*
   ~~r~~~~~ /1
  ~~~~~~~r /2
 ~~~~~~~~ /3
~~~~~r~~ /4
*/

drawRace([3, 7, -2], 12)
/*
  ~~~r~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~~~~r~ /3
*/
```

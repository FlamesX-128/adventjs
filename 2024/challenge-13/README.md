# Challenge #13: ðŸ¤– Is the robot back?

The elves at the North Pole have created a **special robot** ðŸ¤– that helps Santa Claus distribute gifts inside a large warehouse. **The robot moves on a 2D plane and we start from the origin (0, 0)**.

We want to know if, after executing a series of movements, the robot returns to exactly where it started.

The robot's basic commands are:

- `L`: Move to the left
- `R`: Move to the right
- `U`: Move upwards
- `D`: Move downwards

But it also has certain modifiers for the movements:

- `*`: The movement is done with double intensity (e.g., `*R` means `RR`)
- `!`: The next movement is inverted (e.g., `R!L` is considered as `RR`)
- `?`: The next movement is done only if it hasn't been done before (e.g., `R?R` means `R`)

**Note**: When the movement is inverted with `!` **the inverted movement is counted and not the original one**. For example, `!U?U` inverts the `U` movement, so it counts as having done the `D` movement but not the `U`. Thus, `!U?U` translates to `D?U`, and therefore, the final `U` movement is done.

You must return:

- `true`: if the robot returns exactly to where it started
- `[x, y]`: if the robot does not return to where it started, return the position where it stopped

```js
isRobotBack('R')     // [1, 0]
isRobotBack('RL')    // true
isRobotBack('RLUD')  // true
isRobotBack('*RU')   // [2, 1]
isRobotBack('R*U')   // [1, 2]
isRobotBack('LLL!R') // [-4, 0]
isRobotBack('R?R')   // [1, 0]
isRobotBack('U?D')   // true
isRobotBack('R!L')   // [2,0]
isRobotBack('U!D')   // [0,2]
isRobotBack('R?L')   // true
isRobotBack('U?U')   // [0,1]
isRobotBack('*U?U')  // [0,2]
isRobotBack('U?D?U') // true

// Step-by-step examples:
isRobotBack('R!U?U') // [1,0]
// 'R'  -> moves to the right 
// '!U' -> inverts and becomes 'D'
// '?U' -> moves upwards, because the 'U' movement hasn't been done yet

isRobotBack('UU!U?D') // [0,1]
// 'U'  -> moves upwards
// 'U'  -> moves upwards
// '!U' -> inverts and becomes 'D'
// '?D' -> does not move, since the 'D' movement has already been done
```

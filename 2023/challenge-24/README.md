# Challenge #24: 🪜 Jump on the stairs

In the village of Santa, there is a magic staircase that leads to the toy factory 🧸. The elves, always looking to get exercise and have fun 🏃‍♂️, decide to jump the steps of the staircase.

They give us `steps` as the number of steps on the staircase and the maximum number of steps `maxJump` that an elf can jump in a single jump.

Your task is to help the elves find **all the possible sequences of jumps they can make to go up the staircase, sorted from least to most**. Considering that the elves can jump at most maxJump steps in a single jump (but they can jump fewer steps if they wish).

For example, if there is a staircase of `steps = 4` and `maxJump = 2` is the maximum number of steps that an elf can jump in a single jump, then there are five possible jumping sequences:

- `[1, 1, 1, 1]` (jumps 1 step 4 times)
- `[1, 1, 2]` (jumps 1 step 2 times and then 2 steps)
- `[1, 2, 1]` (jumps 1 step, then 2 steps and then 1 step)
- `[2, 1, 1]` (jumps 2 steps, then 1 step and then 1 step)
- `[2, 2]` (jumps 2 steps 2 times)

More examples:

```js
getStaircasePaths(2, 1) // [[1, 1]]
getStaircasePaths(3, 3) // [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3]]
getStaircasePaths(5, 1) // [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
getStaircasePaths(5, 2)
/*
[
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 1, 1],
  [1, 2, 2],
  [2, 1, 1, 1],
  [2, 1, 2],
  [2, 2, 1],
]

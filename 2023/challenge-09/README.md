# Challenge #9: 游뚽 Switch the lights

They are turning on the **Christmas lights** 游꾻 in the city and, as every year, they have to be fixed!

The lights are of two colors: 游댮 and 游릭 . For the effect to be appropriate, **they must always alternate**.** That is, if the first light is red, the second must be green, the third red, the fourth green, etc.

We have been asked to write a function `adjustLights` that, given an array of strings with the color of each light, return the **minimum number** of lights that need to be changed for the colors to alternate.

```js
adjustLights(['游릭', '游댮', '游릭', '游릭', '游릭'])
// -> 1 (you change the fourth light to 游댮)

adjustLights(['游댮', '游댮', '游릭', '游릭', '游댮'])
// -> 2 (you change the second light to 游릭 and the third to 游댮)

adjustLights(['游릭', '游댮', '游릭', '游댮', '游릭'])
// -> 0 (they are already alternating)

adjustLights(['游댮', '游댮', '游댮'])
// -> 1 (you change the second light to 游릭)
```

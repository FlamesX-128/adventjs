# Challenge #3: üòè The naughty elf

In Santa's workshop, **a mischievous elf** has been playing around with the gift production line, adding or removing an unplanned step.

You have the original sequence of `original` manufacturing steps and the modified `modified` sequence that may include an extra step or be missing a step.

Your task is to **write a function that identifies and returns the first extra step that was added or removed in the manufacturing chain**. If there is no difference between the sequences, return an empty string.

```js
const original = 'abcd'
const modified = 'abcde'
findNaughtyStep(original, modified) // 'e'

const original = 'stepfor'
const modified = 'stepor'
findNaughtyStep(original, modified) // 'f'

const original = 'abcde'
const modified = 'abcde'
findNaughtyStep(original, modified) // ''
```

Please, keep in mind:

- There will always be one different step or none.
- The modification can occur anywhere in the string.
- The original steps could be empty

# Challenge #5: ðŸ›· Santa's CyberTruck

Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer, on a North Pole road. The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

- `.` = Road
- `S` = Santa's Sled
- `*` = Open barrier
- `|` = Closed barrier

Example of a road: S...|....|.....

Each unit of time, **the sled moves one position to the right**. If it encounters a closed barrier, it stops until the barrier opens. If it is open, it goes through directly.

**All barriers start closed**, but after 5 units of time, they all open forever.

**Create a function that simulates the sled's movement** for a given time and **returns an array** of strings representing the state of the road at each unit of time:

```js
const road = 'S..|...|..'
const time = 10 // units of time
const result = cyberReindeer(road, time)

/* -> result:
[
  'S..|...|..', // initial state
  '.S.|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '...S...*..', // barrier opens, sled advances
  '...*S..*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*.S.*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*..S*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*...S..', // passes through the open barrier
]
*/
```

The result is an **array where each element shows the road at each unit of time**.

Take into account that **if the sled is in the same position as a barrier**, then it takes its place in the array.

The elves were **inspired by this Code Wars challenge**.

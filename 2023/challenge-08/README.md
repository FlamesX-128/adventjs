# Challenge #8: üè¨ Sorting the warehouse

The elves are very busy in Santa Claus' workshop organizing gifts üéÅ for Christmas Eve üéÑ.

The input format is special, as it indicates the number of gifts and the type of gift with letters from `a` to `z`. For example, `'66a11b'` means 66 a gifts and 11 b gifts.

The elves have a **special system** for organizing the gifts:

- Every 10 gifts of the same type are packed in a box, represented by `{x}`. For example, 20 type a gifts are packed in two boxes like this: `{a}{a}`.

- Every 5 boxes are stacked on a pallet, represented by `[x]`. For example, 10 a boxes are stacked on 2 pallets in this way: `[a][a]`

- Any additional gift is placed in a bag, represented by `()` and all of them are placed inside. For example, 4 b gifts are placed in a bag like this `(bbbb)`

**The gifts are then placed in the following order**: pallets, *boxes and bags*. And the gifts appear in the same order as the input string.

Your task is to write a function `organizeGifts` that takes a string of gifts as an argument and returns a string representing the warehouse.

```js
const result1 = organizeGifts('76a11b')
console.log(result1)
// `[a]{a}{a}(aaaaaa){b}(b)`

/* Explanation:

  76a: 76 gifts type 'a' would be packed in 7 boxes and 6 gifts would be left, resulting in 1 pallet [a] (for the first 5 boxes), 2 loose boxes {a}{a} and a bag with 6 gifts (aaaaaa)

  11b: 11 gifts type 'b' would be packed in 1 box and 1 gift would be left, resulting in 1 loose box {b} and a bag with 1 gift (b)
```
